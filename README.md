## 🎯 Chosen Vertical: Physical Event Experience

Navigating massive 50,000+ seat stadiums often turns an exhilarating event into a stressful logistical nightmare. From gridlocked concourses and endless concession lines to genuine safety hazards during emergencies—the physical event experience is ripe for disruption. **ArenaFlow** is engineered to precisely eliminate these bottlenecks, transforming chaos into a seamless, highly engaging fan journey.

## 🧠 Approach and Logic: Agentic Workflow Architecture

ArenaFlow wasn't just traditional coded; it was **orchestrated**. 

Our unique methodology involved an advanced "agentic workflow" approach. The entire application—from concept to automated CI/CD deployment—was architected through sophisticated prompt engineering and AI collaboration (via Antigravity). Rather than relying solely on traditional hand-coding, we prioritized:
- **Clean Architecture Principles:** Ensuring modular, scalable, and highly testable code.
- **Automated Infrastructure:** Leveraging CI/CD pipelines to guarantee seamless deployments.
- **AI-Driven Engineering:** Accelerating development velocity while strictly enforcing rigorous software design patterns.

## ⚙️ How the Solution Works

ArenaFlow proactively resolves stadium congestion through three core pillars:

### 1. 🗺️ Smart Routing
Real-time indoor mapping dynamically routes fans around concourse bottlenecks. By anticipating foot traffic, ArenaFlow acts as a smart navigator for the stadium, guiding users to their assigned seats, restrooms, or emergency exits via the most efficient, least-crowded paths.

### 2. ⚡ Express Queueing
Live wait-time tracking and intuitive mobile ordering empower fans to bypass concession lines entirely. Users can view localized queues in real-time, order directly from their seats, and pick up refreshments exactly when they are ready—maximizing their time enjoying the event.

### 3. 🚨 Coordination Hub
Geo-fenced push notifications provide localized, immediate crowd coordination. Whether it is a gate closure, an emergency evacuation, or a flash merchandise promotion, the coordination hub ensures ultra-relevant, context-aware communication to specific stadium zones.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

Built for performance, scalability, and seamless cross-platform accessibility:
- **Frontend / Core:** [Flutter Web](https://flutter.dev/) (Ensuring a beautiful, native-like experience directly in the mobile browser without app store friction).
- **Backend & Database:** [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Cloud Firestore for sub-second real-time data synchronization).
- **State Management:** [BLoC Pattern](https://bloclibrary.dev/) (Business Logic Component for deeply predictable, reactive UI states).
- **CI/CD & DevOps:** [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (Automated continuous deployment directly to GitHub Pages).

## 🧐 Assumptions Made

For the scope of this hackathon prototype, the following logical assumptions were structured into our system design:
1. **Connectivity:** The host stadium is equipped with high-density WiFi or comprehensive 5G infrastructure to support real-time data streaming to thousands of concurrently active devices.
2. **User Permissions:** End-users have granted location services and push notification permissions on their personal devices for location-aware routing.
3. **IoT Integration:** The Firebase mock data utilized in this prototype accurately represents the shape and frequency of data incoming from live, stadium-installed IoT sensors (e.g., automated turnstile counters, optical foot-traffic cameras).
